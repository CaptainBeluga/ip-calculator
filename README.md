Subnet Mask and IP Calculator 🌐📈

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue.svg)

This project is a Python script to calculate the subnet mask, network address, broadcast address, and the number of available hosts between two IP addresses in CIDR notation.

🚀 Features

- Convert IP addresses from dotted-decimal notation (e.g., "192.168.0.1") to binary format.
- Extract the subnet mask from an IP address in CIDR notation and convert it to binary.
- Calculate the network address and broadcast address using logical AND and OR operations with the subnet mask.
- Determine the number of available hosts within the given network.

  🛠️ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   `https://github.com/CaptainBeluga/ip-calculator.git`

2. Run the script:
   `python ip_calc.py`

3. Enter the IP address and SubnetMask in CIDR notation (e.g., "192.168.0.0/24")
